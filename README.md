<h1>Python Space Invaders Game</h1>

 ### [YouTube Demonstration](https://youtu.be/ZDEuECj_2yU)

<h2>Description</h2>
This is a Space Invaders based game that I created in python. In one of my scripting courses we were required to create a game that would spawn enemies at the right side of the screen and have them move leftwards. The objective is similar to space invaders in that you kill the aliens to gain points and try to prevent them from hitting you or your side of the screen. My professor at the time had us craft a two type of health system that being the heart icons(health) and the space ship icons (lives). This project encapsulates my vast knowledge in  the language of python that can be smoothly transitioned to almost any other programming language.
